ARCHIVE FOLDER
==============

This folder is for older versions and deprecated project files.

PURPOSE:
- Store outdated project versions
- Keep deprecated features for reference
- Maintain project history without cluttering active workspace
- Backup important files that are no longer in active development

USAGE:
Move completed or deprecated projects here to keep the ACTIVE_PROJECTS folder clean and fast-loading.
