# ðŸ”§ Domain Configuration Fix for wavetype.xyz

## Current Issue
Domain resolves to: `185.27.134.60` (incorrect)
Should resolve to: `76.76.19.61` (Vercel)

## Fix DNS Records

### Option 1: Use Vercel's Recommended DNS
Go to your domain registrar and update DNS records:

```
Type: A      Name: @      Value: 76.76.19.61
Type: CNAME  Name: www    Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### Option 2: Use Vercel's Anycast (Recommended)
Replace the A record with CNAME:

```
Type: CNAME  Name: @      Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
Type: CNAME  Name: www    Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Login to your domain registrar** (where you bought wavetype.xyz)
2. **Go to DNS management** (usually called DNS, Nameservers, or Domain Settings)
3. **Delete existing A record** pointing to 185.27.134.60
4. **Add new records** as shown above
5. **Save changes**
6. **Wait 5-30 minutes** for DNS propagation

## Test After Changes:
```bash
# Check DNS resolution
nslookup wavetype.xyz

# Should show: 76.76.19.61 or cname.vercel-dns.com
```

## Alternative: Use Vercel Subdomain Temporarily
While DNS propagates, your site is available at:
`https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

Check your Vercel dashboard for the exact URL.

## Verification Steps:
1. DNS resolves to correct IP
2. https://wavetype.xyz loads
3. 3D car viewer displays
4. No SSL certificate errors
